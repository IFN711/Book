<p class="auth-t">
Claire Raylor lives in Brisbane, Australia. She is a
registered nurse and has recently ventured into working
with children with disabilities. Claire has always been
interested in writing and has attended workshops as
a hobby. She has previously had some nursing articles
published, but to see her early learning books published
is a dream come true, especially for such a good cause –
a charity changing the lives of others.</p>


<p class="auth-t">A message from the author:</p>
<p class="auth-t">To my good friend Beth Wilkins for all her advice and her
generosity with her time in order to help me achieve my
goal in having a book published and her encouragement
along the way.</p>
<p class="auth-t">And also Michelle Worthington - Author for sharing her
knowledge and experience in the Library For All writers’
workshop and her advice beyond that day.</p>
