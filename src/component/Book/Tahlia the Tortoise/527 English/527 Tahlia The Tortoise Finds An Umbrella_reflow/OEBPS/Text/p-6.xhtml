“You need to get under cover,” a
voice from nowhere commanded.
“Where is your umbrella?”
</div>

<div class="p" style="line-height: 35px">Tahlia looked under a bush to
try and find where the voice
was coming from. “Who said
that?” she cried.</div>
<div class="p" style="line-height: 35px">Big splodges began to tumble
onto her shell. “Ohhh, I don’t
like this! Help! Someone help!”
Tahlia didn’t know which way
to turn.</div>
